👷‍♂ I create [Projector](https://jetbrains.com/projector) at JetBrains. If you want to use Swing applications like IDEA in an iPad, an Android tablet, or a browser, take a look at our project :)

👨‍🏭 As a 20% project, I work on [Kotlin/Py backend](https://github.com/krzema12/kotlin-python).

⚒ In spare time, I implement open source projects. Mostly it's about porting old games and software to current platforms (like [Heroes](https://github.com/SerVB/pph)). And sometimes developing something new (like [CRDT-based text editor](https://github.com/decentralized-hse/collab-edit)). Take a look at my pined repos, and if you want to join, feel free to contact me!

What about other interests?

👨‍🎓 I like to participate in education. I was a Kotlin elective assistant at the Higher School of Economics for 3 years. Now I'm planning to teach an elective about Open Source and start creating educational videos at YouTube.

📚 I love reading ('cause it's the fastest way to understand new things for me), 🎥 TV-series (firstly to learn English but then I went mad), 🎮 video games (just 4 fun w/ friends or adventure metroidvanias), and 😎 VR (the only sweaty activity I like).

🎶 To reach the flow, I listen to [Synthwave, Sovietwave](https://air2.radiorecord.ru:805/synth_320), and [Deep House](https://air2.radiorecord.ru:805/deep_320). [Radio Record](https://www.radiorecord.ru/) rocks!
